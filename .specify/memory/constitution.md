# DiagramDesigner Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
Every feature MUST prioritize user experience and intuitive interaction. Design decisions MUST be validated against real user workflows for diagram creation, editing, and collaboration. Features that add complexity without clear user value are prohibited.

**Rationale**: Diagram tools succeed when they reduce cognitive load and accelerate visual communication, not when they showcase technical capabilities at the expense of usability.

### II. Visual Clarity
The diagram rendering engine MUST maintain pixel-perfect accuracy, consistent styling, and performant rendering across all supported export formats. Visual output quality is non-negotiable.

**Rationale**: A diagram tool's primary value is visual communication - any degradation in output quality undermines the core product value.

### III. Modular Architecture
All features MUST be implemented as independent, composable modules with clear interfaces. Diagram components (shapes, connectors, layouts) MUST be self-contained and reusable across different diagram types.

**Rationale**: Modular design enables rapid feature iteration, easier testing, and allows users to combine capabilities in unexpected ways.

### IV. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is MANDATORY for all code changes:
- Tests MUST be written before implementation
- Tests MUST fail initially (red phase)
- Implementation proceeds only after test approval
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced

**Rationale**: Diagram tools involve complex state management and rendering logic where bugs directly impact user deliverables. TDD ensures correctness from the start.

### V. Performance & Responsiveness
The application MUST maintain 60fps interaction during diagram editing and MUST handle diagrams with 1000+ elements without degradation. All user actions MUST provide feedback within 100ms.

**Rationale**: Diagram creation is a creative flow activity - performance lag breaks concentration and reduces productivity.

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests**: All business logic, algorithms, and utilities
- **Integration tests**: Component interactions, state management, persistence
- **Visual regression tests**: Rendering output across formats (SVG, PNG, PDF)
- **Performance benchmarks**: Frame rate, memory usage, load times

### Code Quality
- All code MUST pass linting and formatting checks
- Code reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Complexity MUST be justified and documented in Complexity Tracking sections
- Technical debt MUST be tracked and scheduled for resolution

### Documentation
- API contracts MUST use OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas
- User-facing features MUST include quickstart guides
- Architecture decisions MUST be documented in research.md files
- Breaking changes MUST include migration guides
- **All diagrams MUST use Mermaid syntax** for consistency and renderability (no ASCII art or images)

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process
1. Feature specification (spec.md) defines WHAT and WHY
2. Implementation plan (plan.md) addresses HOW with technical research
3. Contract-first design generates API schemas and data models
4. Tests written and approved before implementation
5. Implementation follows tasks.md execution order
6. Validation against quickstart scenarios

### Code Review Requirements
- All PRs MUST pass automated tests and constitutional checks
- Reviewers MUST verify TDD compliance (tests committed before implementation)
- Performance regressions MUST be identified and addressed
- Visual changes MUST include before/after screenshots or recordings

### Constitutional Compliance
- Constitution supersedes all other practices and conventions
- Violations require explicit justification in Complexity Tracking
- Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan
- This constitution is version-controlled and follows semantic versioning

## Governance

### Amendment Process
1. Proposed changes documented with rationale
2. Impact analysis on existing features and templates
3. Team approval required for MINOR/MAJOR changes
4. Version bump following semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Backward incompatible principle changes or removals
   - MINOR: New principles or materially expanded guidance
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Versioning Policy
- Constitution version tracked at bottom of this document
- Ratification date marks original adoption
- Last amended date updated with each change
- All feature plans reference constitution version used

### Compliance Review
- Weekly reviews of merged PRs for constitutional adherence
- Quarterly architecture reviews to assess accumulated technical debt
- Annual constitution review to assess relevance and effectiveness
