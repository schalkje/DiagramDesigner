# Feature Specification: DiagramDesigner Application

**Feature Branch**: `main`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "the application has a front-end, a backend and a database that runs locally and can later be deployed to azure"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a data architect, I need a comprehensive diagram design application with a frontend interface, backend services, and persistent database storage that runs on my local machine for development and can be deployed to Azure for production use, so that I can create, manage, and collaborate on data model diagrams with professional quality and scalability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is not installed, **When** I run the local setup, **Then** the frontend, backend, and database all start successfully on my local machine
2. **Given** the application is running locally, **When** I create a new diagram with entities and relationships, **Then** the data is persisted in the local database and survives application restarts
3. **Given** I have created diagrams locally, **When** I deploy the application to Azure, **Then** all my diagrams and data migrate successfully to the cloud environment
4. **Given** the application is deployed on Azure, **When** multiple users access it simultaneously, **Then** all users can create and edit their own diagrams without conflicts
5. **Given** the application is running (locally or Azure), **When** I perform any operation, **Then** the backend API handles business logic while the frontend provides the user interface
6. **Given** the application is deployed to Azure, **When** I need to scale up, **Then** the architecture supports horizontal scaling of backend services and database resources

### Edge Cases
- What happens when local database becomes corrupted? Backup and recovery mechanisms
- How does the application handle network failures between frontend and backend? Retry logic and user feedback
- What happens during Azure deployment if the database migration fails? Rollback strategy
- Can users switch between local and cloud instances? Data export/import support
- How are database schema changes managed across environments? Migration scripts and versioning
- What happens when Azure resources reach capacity limits? Auto-scaling and monitoring
